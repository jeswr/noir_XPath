# String Operations Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Added String Operations Module** (`xpath/src/string.nr`)
   - Implemented XPath string functions that can work within Noir's constraints
   - **Fully working functions** (4 functions returning boolean/numeric values):
     - `string_length` - Returns the length of a string (STRLEN) ✅
     - `starts_with` - Checks if string starts with prefix (STRSTARTS) ✅
     - `ends_with` - Checks if string ends with suffix (STRENDS) ✅
     - `contains` - Checks if string contains substring (CONTAINS) ✅

2. **Removed Non-Functional Stub Functions**
   - The following functions were initially attempted but removed due to Noir limitations:
     - `substring` - Cannot extract substring (SUBSTR) ❌
     - `upper_case` - Cannot convert to uppercase (UCASE) ❌
     - `lower_case` - Cannot convert to lowercase (LCASE) ❌
     - `substring_before` - Cannot get substring before delimiter (STRBEFORE) ❌
     - `substring_after` - Cannot get substring after delimiter (STRAFTER) ❌
     - `concat` - Cannot concatenate strings (CONCAT) ❌
     - `concat3` - Cannot concatenate three strings ❌

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README.md to reflect only working string operations
   - Updated SPARQL_COVERAGE.md to mark working vs non-working functions
   - Added clear explanations about Noir limitations in code and documentation

4. **Note on External Dependencies**
   - Initially attempted to use external `noir-string-utils` library
   - Encountered version compatibility issues with current Noir version
   - Implemented string operations natively instead where possible

## Current State and Limitations

**CRITICAL LIMITATION**: Noir does not provide a way to convert byte arrays back to strings at runtime. This means:
- ✅ Functions that return boolean or numeric values work correctly (4 functions)
- ❌ Functions that need to create new strings cannot be implemented (7 functions removed)

Only the working functions are exported in the public API.

## Implementation Approach

String operations were implemented using:
- Noir's native `str<N>` type
- Byte array manipulation via `as_bytes()` for inspection
- Compile-time generic parameters for string sizes (`let N: u32`)
- **Key constraint**: Cannot convert byte arrays back to strings (no `bytes_to_str` equivalent exists in Noir)

This approach:
- ✅ No external dependencies required
- ✅ Full compatibility with current Noir version
- ✅ Type safety at compile time
- ✅ Clean API exporting only functional operations
- ✅ 4 out of 11 originally planned functions are usable

## Testing

Unit tests in `xpath_unit_tests/src/string_tests.nr` cover only the working functions:
- String length calculation
- String searching (starts-with, ends-with, contains)
- Tests validate both positive and negative cases
- All 88 unit tests pass
